      <h2 id="10">#10 SSX 3</h2>
      <img src = "/images/ssx 3.gif" alt = "SSX 3 Image.">
      <p>Starting off my list with SSX 3, a creative and kooky snowboarding game released October 2003 on PS2. It's a silly and dumb but action packed snowboarding game filled with packed y2k-esque character list, beautiful mountainous screny and death dyfing overload a tricks. A true PS2 staple and a bonafide console classic.</p><br>

      <h2 id="9">#9 Gears of War: Judgement</h2>
      <img src = "/images/gow judgement.gif" alt = "Gears of War Judgement Image.">
      <p>My 1st time in a game when I felt the most like a sniper pro. Gear of War Judgement is a shorter installment in the franchise following the character from previous games, Baird. I will say...the multi-player is what hooked me on more than the actually story (a reoccuing theme.) A fun shooter, with varirous characters and races with enough weapons & modes to keep me happy for hours!</p><br>

      <h2 id="8">#8 Borderlands Pre-Sequel</h2>
      <img src = "/images/borderlands pr.gif" alt = "Borderlands Pre Sequel Image.">
      <p>Probably the franchises most hated release among the fanbase, is in fact my favorite! This game follows 4 devout members of Crimson Squad (or friends of) as they join forces to defeat the villian of the title, Handsome Jack. One of most fun with friends you'll have! The random drop of guns I believe has over 100,000 possibilities so...you'll spending a lot of time shooting and looting.</p><br>

      <h2 id="7">#7 Final Fantasy XII</h2>
      <img src = "/images/final fantasy 12.gif" alt = "Final Fantasy 12 Image.">
      <p>Story based are hard for me to stick with sometimes, but this title has enough missions, characters (with great development) and enough depth and lighthearted to entertain a younger and adult me for hours. The story revoloves around Vaan and set of characters both friends and forced companions as they travel vast to take down a corrupt empire. Think...Star Wars but Final Fantasy style.</p><br>

      <h2 id="6">#6 Mass Effect 3</h2>
      <img src = "/images/mass effect 3.gif" alt = "Mass Effect 3 Image.">
      <p>Coming back to games I only played multi-player on...this is definitely a great one! It follows Captain Sheperd as he/she runs an airship across the galaxy to do...things? My knowledge mostly lies with the mp with I LOVE! Multiple races and 6 different classifications in move sets (Vanguard is a fav & the A.I. unit my fav character) volleying through different environments destroying villians coming in anything from an attacking floating robot so a glitch phasing Banshee!</p><br>

      <h2 id="5">#5 Final Fantasy X-2</h2>
      <img src = "/images/final fantasy x2.gif" alt = "Final Fantasy X-2 Image.">
      <p>The 1st sequel to a main game of the franchise, Final Fantasy X-2, is like it's predecessor but like...Charlie's Angels themed. It follows returning characters Yuna and Rikki and newcomer Paine as they embark on an exploration of a familiar world with the mission of discovering the true meaning behind a mystery sphere and a world adapting to the choices made from the previous game. Truly a very fun game! (Minus the new Blitzball version)</p><br>

      <h2 id="4">#4 DJ Hero</h2>
      <img src ="/images/dj hero.gif" alt = "DJ Hero Image.">
      <p>A very unlikely entry and one many people don't even know about. Most popular Rock Band and Guitar Hero get all the glory, but DJ Hero has all the fun! Fantastic soundtrack and truly testing hand and coordination game that simply let's you achieve your deep hidden dream of being a DJ. A Flash warning is neccessary before diving deep into your turntable, but you'll be hooked after the tutorial!</p><br>

      <h2 id="3">#3 Left 4 Dead 2</h2>
      <img src = "/images/l4d2.webp" alt = "Left 4 Dead 2 Image.">
      <p>My Top 3 was kinda hard to decide, this title hear holds...a very special place in my gamer heart and is my 1st "cult" game! (I played this for a little over 2 years straight shockingly!) L4D2 following 4 survivors of a zombie apocalypse as they shoot, axe and Tank fight their way through the remains of cities to reach the rescue team. This game will have you flitch and have you on your seat as it's not just invested with regualr zombies, but special infected with enough disrupting powers to eliminated your team right from the start! Released in 2009 and is still better than 99% games realized since...</p><br>

      <h2 id="2">#2 Overwatch</h2>
      <img src = "/images/overwatch.gif" alt = "Overwatch Image.">
      <p>Omg don't boo me...I can't help it, I love Overwatch! A 26(or so) roster of Heroes, Villians, and hacking double crossers? (Sombra in the gif, also my Fav from the game), is solely a multi-player game that has many cinematics to help bulid a sort of superhero-esque world around the lot. Depending the mode, but it's your team vs. the other fighting to either capture/defend a point, defeat a Halloween Robot apocalypse, or push an objective to it's final destination, there's SO much this game has to other and enough people on it's roster for any to find someone they'd love to hear voiceline after voiceline from.</p><br>

      <h2 id="1"> #1 Final Fantasy X</h2>
      <img src = "/images/final fantasy x.webp" alt = "Final Fantasy X Image.">
      <p>Well the end of my place, and yes easily my favorite and best game ever made, Final Fantasy X! The game follows Tidus as he navaigates to a wolrd he's been transformed to and now embarks on an adventrous and emotional journey with his new found friend as one literlly marches to their death in quest of bringing peace to the world of Spira. A story based, turn based game that has gorgeous soundtrack, a mezmerizing soundtrack and great round of characters all around, you'll be instantly draw in and intrigued after hearing the 1st words "Listen to my story..." I don't know a better game truly.</p><br>
